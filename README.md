# Onyx
Onyx is a password manager that I coded (felt like I needed to have my own :), because they're so freakinn long and complicated. +, I don't trust dashlane x)

The app works with a simple Fernet encryption. It's made for personal use and is way too vulnerable to be considered as 
a secure app (we can litteraly say that the door's open for hackers with this). It's a way for me to introduce myself to encryption
tokens etc...

The only goal is to have a password manager disconnected from any type of cloud or API and strong enough to protect my passwords from lambda users. They'll just see endless successions of random caracters to which they are alergic too I think.
