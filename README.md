Currently working on a password manager, because they're so freakinn long and complicated. +, I don't trust dashlane x)

The app works with a simple Fernet encryption. It's made for personal use and is way too vulnerable to be considered as 
a secure app (we can litteraly say that the door's open for hackers with this). It's a way for me to introduce myself to encryption
tokens etc...
